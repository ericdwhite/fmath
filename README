Some sample Clojure code while I work through Paul Wilmott - Introduces Quantitative Finace.


Getting Started
---------------
cd clj
lein deps
LEIN_SNAPSHOTS_IN_RELEASE=true lein jar
java -cp fmath-0.0.1.jar:lib/* fmath.core

Then in your browser navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:8080/


Packaging (Uses Fabric)
-----------------------
See: clj/FABRIC.md


Side Note: Installing Fabric (min 1.0.1)
----------------------------------------
I carried out these steps on my development box.  The host
server doesn't need to have Fabric installed.

Note: the script require at least version 1.0.0 (0.9.0 will
not work.

sudo apt-get install python-dev pip
sudo pip install --upgrade fabric
